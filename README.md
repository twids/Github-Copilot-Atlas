# Copilot Atlas

A multi-agent orchestration system for VS Code Copilot that enables complex software development workflows through intelligent agent delegation and parallel execution.

> Built upon the foundation of [copilot-orchestra](https://github.com/ShepAlderson/copilot-orchestra) by ShepAlderson, with agent naming conventions inspired by [oh-my-opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode).

> **Note:** Best supported on VS Code Insiders (as of January 2026) for access to the latest agent orchestration features.

## Overview

This repository contains custom agent prompts that work together to handle the complete software development lifecycle: **Planning → Implementation → Review → Commit**. The system uses a conductor-delegate pattern where a main orchestrator (Atlas) coordinates specialized subagents to efficiently tackle complex development tasks.

## Architecture

### Primary Agents

- **Atlas** (`Atlas.agent.md`) - The ORCHESTRATOR
  - **Model:** Claude Opus 4.6 (copilot)
  - Orchestrates the full development lifecycle
  - Delegates to specialized subagents for research, implementation, and review
  - Manages context conservation and parallel execution
  - Handles phase tracking and user approval gates

- **Prometheus** (`Prometheus.agent.md`) - The AUTONOMOUS PLANNER
  - **Model:** Gemini 3.1 Pro (copilot)
  - Researches requirements and analyzes codebases
  - Writes comprehensive TDD-driven implementation plans
  - Automatically hands off to Atlas for execution
  - Supports parallel research across multiple subsystems

### Specialized Subagents

- **Oracle-subagent** (`Oracle-subagent.agent.md`) - THE RESEARCHER
  - **Model:** Gemini 3.1 Pro (copilot)
  - Gathers comprehensive context about tasks
  - Can delegate to Explorer for large-scope research
  - Returns structured findings to parent agents
  - Supports parallel research across independent subsystems

- **Sisyphus-subagent** (`Sisyphus-subagent.agent.md`) - THE IMPLEMENTER
  - **Model:** GPT 5.3-Codex (copilot)
  - Executes implementation following strict TDD principles
  - Writes tests first, then minimal code to pass
  - Handles linting and formatting
  - Can be invoked in parallel for disjoint features

- **Explorer-subagent** (`Explorer-subagent.agent.md`) - THE SCOUT
  - **Model:** Gemini 3 Flash (Preview) (copilot)
  - Rapid file/usage discovery across codebases
  - Read-only exploration (no edits/commands)
  - Returns structured results with file lists and analysis
  - MANDATORY parallel search strategy (3-10 simultaneous searches)

- **Code-Review-subagent** (`Code-Review-subagent.agent.md`) - THE REVIEWER
  - **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 (copilot)
  - Reviews code for correctness, quality, and test coverage
  - Returns structured feedback (APPROVED/NEEDS_REVISION/FAILED)
  - Can be invoked in parallel for independent phases
  - Focus on blocking issues vs nice-to-haves

- **Frontend-Engineer-subagent** (`Frontend-Engineer-subagent.agent.md`) - THE UI/UX SPECIALIST
  - **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 (copilot)
  - Implements user interfaces, styling, and responsive layouts
  - Expert in modern frontend frameworks and tooling
  - Follows TDD principles for frontend (component tests first)
  - Focuses on accessibility and responsive design

## Key Features

### � Context Conservation: The Game Changer

**Why This Matters:** Traditional single-agent approaches force one model to handle everything—research, implementation, review, documentation—all within a limited context window. This quickly exhausts precious tokens on context that could be used for your actual code.

**How Copilot Atlas Solves It:** By delegating tasks to specialized subagents, we radically improve context efficiency:

- **Researcher agents** (Oracle, Explorer) read and analyze large codebases, returning only high-signal summaries—not the raw 50,000 lines of code
- **Implementer agents** (Sisyphus) focus solely on the files they're modifying, not rereading the entire project architecture
- **Reviewer agents** (Code-Review) examine only changed files, not context from the research phase
- **The Conductor** (Atlas) orchestrates everything without ever touching the bulk of your codebase

**The Result:** What would take 80-90% of a monolithic agent's context now takes 10-15%, leaving 70-80% more tokens for deeper analysis, better reasoning, and faster iterations.

### 🔄 Parallel Agent Execution
- Launch multiple subagents simultaneously for independent tasks
- Explorer: 3-10 parallel searches in first batch
- Oracle: Parallel research across multiple subsystems
- Sisyphus: Parallel implementation for disjoint features
- Maximum 10 parallel agents per phase

### 🧪 Test-Driven Development
- Every phase follows red-green-refactor cycle
- Tests written first, run to fail, then minimal code
- Explicit test → code → test steps in all plans
- No manual testing unless explicitly requested

### 🤝 Proper Agent Handoffs
- VS Code Custom Agent handoff configuration
- Prometheus → Atlas automatic handoff option
- Each agent can declare available delegations
- Clear handoff workflow with user approval gates

### 📋 Structured Planning
- Atlas-compatible plan format
- 3-10 incremental, self-contained phases
- Open questions with options/recommendations
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Usage

### Planning a Feature with Prometheus

```
Plan a comprehensive implementation for adding user authentication to the app
```

Prometheus will:
1. Research the codebase (delegating to Explorer/Oracle as needed)
2. Write a detailed TDD plan with 3-10 phases
3. Offer to invoke Atlas automatically or let you review first

### Executing a Plan with Atlas

```
Implement the plan devised by Prometheus
```

OR: Accept the hand-off from Prometheus by clicking `Start implementation with Atlas`


Atlas will:
1. Review the plan
2. Delegate Phase 1 implementation to Sisyphus
3. Delegate review to Code-Review
4. Present results and wait for commit approval
5. Continue through all phases

### Direct Research with Oracle

```
Let @Oracle research how the database layer is structured
```

Oracle will:
1. Delegate to Explorer for file discovery (if >10 files)
2. Analyze key files and patterns
3. Return structured findings

### Quick Exploration with Explorer

```
Let @Explorer find all files related to authentication
```

Explorer will:
1. Launch 3-10 parallel searches immediately
2. Read necessary files to confirm relationships
3. Return structured results with file list and analysis

## Workflow Example

```
User: Prometheus, plan adding a user dashboard feature

Prometheus:
  ├─ @Explorer (find UI components)
  ├─ @Oracle (research data fetching patterns)
  ├─ @Oracle (research state management)
  └─ Writes plan → Offers to invoke Atlas

User: Yes, invoke Atlas

Prometheus:
  └─ Atlas, implement the plan...

Atlas: Phase 1/4 - Test Infrastructure
  └─ @Sisyphus Implement Phase 1
      ├─ Writes tests (fail)
      ├─ Writes minimal code
      └─ Tests pass ✓

Atlas: Reviewing Phase 1
  └─ @Code-Review Review Phase 1
      └─ Status: APPROVED ✓

Atlas: Phase 1 complete! [commit message provided]
```

## Configuration

### Plan Directory
Agents check for plan directory configuration:
1. Look for `AGENTS.md` file in workspace
2. Find plan directory specification (e.g., `.sisyphus/plans`)
3. Default to `plans/` if not specified

### Tool Requirements
All agents declare their required tools in YAML frontmatter:
- `agent` - For delegating to other agents
- `edit` - File editing capabilities
- `search` - Semantic/grep search
- `runCommands/runTasks` - Terminal execution
- etc.

### Handoff Declarations
Prometheus declares its handoff to Atlas:
```yaml
handoff:
  - label: Start implementation with Atlas
    agent: Atlas
    prompt: Implement the plan
```

### Adding Custom Agents

You can extend the Atlas and Prometheus agents with your own specialized agents for domain-specific tasks (e.g., database experts, API specialists, security reviewers, etc.).

#### Quick Method: Let the AI Do It

The fastest way to add a custom agent is to simply ask:

```
@Atlas Create a new subagent called Database-Expert that specializes in SQL optimization, schema design, and query analysis. Integrate it with Prometheus and Atlas so they can delegate database-related tasks to it.
```

Atlas will:
1. Create the agent file with proper YAML frontmatter
2. Add it to Prometheus's research delegation list
3. Add it to Atlas's implementation delegation list
4. Update documentation

#### Manual Method: Step-by-Step

**1. Create Your Agent File**

Create a new file in your prompts directory: `YourAgent-subagent.agent.md`

```yaml
---
description: 'Brief description of what this agent does'
argument-hint: What kind of task to delegate (e.g., "Analyze database schema")
tools: ['search', 'usages', 'edit', 'runCommands', ...]  # Tools your agent needs
model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (copilot)  # Or GPT-5.2, Gemini, etc.
---

You are a [ROLE] SUBAGENT called by a parent CONDUCTOR agent.

**Your specialty:** [Describe the domain expertise]

**Your scope:** [Define what tasks this agent handles]

**Core workflow:**
1. [Step 1 of your agent's process]
2. [Step 2 of your agent's process]
3. [Return structured findings/results]

[Add any additional instructions, constraints, or examples]
```

**2. Integrate with Prometheus** (for research tasks)

Edit `Prometheus.agent.md` and add your agent to the research delegation section:

```markdown
**YourAgent-subagent**:
- Provide a clear research goal related to [domain]
- Instruct to analyze [specific aspects]
- Tell them to return structured findings
```

Also add to Prometheus's constraints if it shouldn't delegate to your agent:
```markdown
- You CAN delegate to YourAgent-subagent for [domain] research
```

**3. Integrate with Atlas** (for implementation/review tasks)

Edit `Atlas.agent.md`:

a. Add to the subagent list at the top:
```markdown
6. YourAgent-subagent: THE [ROLE]. Expert in [domain expertise]
```

b. Add to the subagent instructions section:
```markdown
**YourAgent-subagent**:
- Use #runSubagent to invoke for [task type] tasks
- Provide [specific context needed]
- Instruct to follow [workflow/principles]
- Remind them to report back with [expected output]
```

**4. Test Your Integration**

Try invoking your agent:
```
Let @YourAgent analyze the current database schema
```

Or through Atlas:
```
@Atlas Use YourAgent to optimize our SQL queries in the user service
```

**5. Document Usage** (Optional)

Add an entry to the README's Specialized Subagents section describing when to use your custom agent.

#### Best Practices for Custom Agents

- **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have one clear domain of expertise
- **Clear Scope**: Define exactly what the agent does and doesn't handle
- **Model Selection**: Choose the right model for the task (Sonnet for complex reasoning, Flash for speed, GPT for research)
- **Tool Minimalism**: Only declare tools the agent actually needs
- **Return Format**: Always return structured findings (not raw dumps)
- **Parallel-Aware**: Consider if your agent can run in parallel with others

#### Example Custom Agents

- **Security-Auditor**: Reviews code for vulnerabilities, dependency issues, auth flaws
- **Performance-Analyzer**: Profiles code, identifies bottlenecks, suggests optimizations
- **API-Designer**: Reviews/designs REST/GraphQL APIs, ensures consistency
- **Documentation-Writer**: Generates comprehensive docs from code
- **Migration-Expert**: Handles database migrations, version upgrades, refactoring

## Requirements

- **VS Code Insiders** (recommended for latest agent features and bug fixes)
- **GitHub Copilot** subscription with multi-agent support
- **VS Code Settings:**
  ```json
  {
    "chat.customAgentInSubagent.enabled": true,
    "github.copilot.chat.responsesApiReasoningEffort": "high"
  }
  ```
  - `customAgentInSubagent.enabled`: Allow subagents to use custom agents defined in a '-agents.md' file like the ones above 
  - `responsesApiReasoningEffort`: Set to "high" for enhanced reasoning in planning agents (GPT models)

## Best Practices

1. **Use Prometheus for complex features** - Let it research and plan before implementation
2. **Leverage parallel execution** - Invoke multiple Explorers/Oracles for large tasks
3. **Trust the TDD workflow** - Each phase is self-contained with tests
4. **Review before proceeding** - Check completed phases before moving forward
5. **Commit frequently** - After each approved phase after properly testing and ensuring phase functionality
6. **Delegate appropriately** - Let subagents handle heavy lifting
